# Binary Tree Is Complete

## Problem
Write a method to check whether a binary tree is complete. A binary tree is
complete if all nodes except the last level is fully filled. The last level
must be filled from right to left.

## Requirements
- A null tree should return true.

- Method to implement:

| Name       | IsComplete                                                    |
| Parameters | The binary tree to check                                      |
| Returns    | True if the tree is complete, false otherwise.                |

## Solutions
1. Standard - Simple iterative solution using DFS like algorithm.

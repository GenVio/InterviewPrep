# Some C# Notes:

Sealed classes cannot be inherited from. 

Arrays in C# are of one type and are of fixed length. 
Why the heck would you ever use an array? and note an arraylist? 

Namespaces are containers for classes. We will use namespaces for grouping the related classes in C# Using keyword can be used for using the namespace in other namespaces. 

Const makes an entity a contstant. 

'readonly' variable value can be changed during runtime and value to readonly variables can be assigned in the contructor at the time of declaration. 

'const' must be defined at runtime. 

'Static' keyword for a class makes all members static. If the variable is made static then it will have a single instance and the value change is updated in this instance.
